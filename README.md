Overview:
This project aims to predict the burned area of forest fires using 517 wildfire events using the Fire Weather Index (FWI). It is part of my final project for the Machine Learning I course at the University of Potsdam. The project explores various machine learning models to assess their effectiveness in predicting the log-transformed area burned by forest fires.

Objectives:

- Implement machine learning models including: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests & Neural Networks
- Conduct feature engineering and data preprocessing
- Evaluate model performance on both the original and reduced feature sets
- Analyze and compare the results to draw meaningful conclusions

Features:
- Data Preprocessing: Includes handling missing values, log transformation of the target variable, and scaling features using StandardScaler.
- Feature Engineering: Implements one-hot encoding for categorical variables and allows for feature reduction to improve model efficiency.
- Model Evaluation: Utilizes metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess the performance of each model.
