This project aims to predict the burned area of forest fires using meteorological and spatial data. This project is my final project for the University of Potsdam Machine Learning I course. In this project I implemented various machine learning models including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and Neural Networks to predict the log-transformed area burned by forest fires. Feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model evaluation are performed to assess model performance on both the original and reduced feature sets.
