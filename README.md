This project aims to predict the burned area of forest fires using meteorological and spatial data. This project is the final project (Project 2) for the University of Potsdam Machine Learning I course. Various machine learning models including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and Neural Networks were implemented to predict the log-transformed area burned by forest fires. Feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model evaluation are performed to assess model performance on both the original and reduced feature sets.
